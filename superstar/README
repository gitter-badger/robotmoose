Superstar is our web-based robotic information hub.
Using a "star" topology allows both robot and pilot to sit behind firewalls,
and communicate by connecting to the superstar server.


Protocol examples:
   beingthere.cs.uaf.edu/superstar/layla/uaf/battery?get
Read the current (most recent) state of the battery in the UAF layla robot.
Returns raw JSON object as text/json, or empty object if none available.

   beingthere.cs.uaf.edu/superstar/layla/uaf/battery?set={percent:"84";time:"12345"}
Set a new value for the battery state, as an URL-encoded string.  
This overwrites the existing JSON object.

   beingthere.cs.uaf.edu/superstar/layla/?sub
Extract a list of substrings stored starting at this path.
In this case, returns ["uaf"].

TODO: comet-style interface, for non-blocking reads:
   beingthere.cs.uaf.edu/superstar/layla/uaf/battery?after={time:"12345"}
Read any value for the battery state newer than this version.
Blocks until the battery state is newer than this, waiting until
a newer version is set.
